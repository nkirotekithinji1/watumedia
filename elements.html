												 <h2>Watu Media</h2>
											 </header>
											 <p> In order to improve Miriam’s (archetype) cooking experience to one that is healthier, cleaner and cost effective, PS Kenya was implementing a behavior change communication campaign that aimed to create awareness to ‘Miriams’ in Kenya on benefits of cleaner cooking, what cooking technologies exist and where they can be found. The PS Kenya project was multi-sectorial touching on various sectors in Kenya including energy, education, environment, home economics and gender therefore, involvement of these sectors was the key to the successful implementation of the project</p>
